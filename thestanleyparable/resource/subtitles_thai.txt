                "narration.underground_1_01"        "It was a stirring of emotion in his chest, as though he felt more free to think for himself, to question the nature of his job."
                "narration.underground_1_02"        "Why did he feel this now, when for years it had never occured to him?"

                "narration.underground_2_00"        "Stanley walked straight ahead through the large door that read: 'Mind Control Facility.'"
                "narration.monitor_1_00"                "The lights rose on an enormous room packed with television screens."

                "narration.monitor_3_01"                "Had Stanley really been under someone's control all this time? Was this the only reason he was happy with his boring job?"
                "narration.monitor_3_02"                "That his emotions had been manipulated to accept it blindly?"
                "narration.monitor_4_00"                "No! He refused to believe it. He couldn't accept it; his own life in someone else's control? Never!"

                "narration.controls_1_00"                "But here was the proof. The heart of the operation, controls labeled with emotions: 'happy' or 'sad' or 'content.'"

                "narration.controls_1_03"                "For he would dismantle the controls once and for all."
                "narration.controls_2_00"                "And when, at last, he found the source of the room's power, he knew it was his duty, his obligation, to put an end to this horrible place and to everything it stood for."

                "narration.freedom_2_01"                "He had defeated the machine, unshackled himself from someone else's command. Freedom was mere moments away."
                "narration.freedom_2_02"                "And, yet, even as the immense door slowly opened, Stanley reflected on how many puzzles still lay unsolved."
                "narration.freedom_2_03"                "Where had his co-workers gone? How had he been freed from the machine's grasp? What other mysteries did this strange building hold?"
                "narration.freedom_2_04"                "But as sunlight streamed into the chamber, he realized none of this mattered to him. For it was not knowledge, or even power, that he had been seeking, but happiness."

                "narration.freedom_2_06"                "No longer would anyone tell him where to go, what to do, or how to feel. Whatever life he lives, it will be his."
                "narration.freedom_2_07"                "And that was all he needed to know. It was, perhaps, the only thing worth knowing."

                "narration.freedom_3_02"                "And Stanley was happy."

                "narration.countdown_02"                "Oh... Stanley. *sigh* I applaud you effort, I really do, but you need to understand; there's only so much that machine can do."
                "narration.countdown_03"                "You were supposed to let it go, turn the controls off, and leave. If you want to throw my story off track, you're going to have to do much better than that."

In the event that this machine is activated without proper DNA identification, nuclear detonators are set to explode, eliminating the entire complex."
                "narration.countdown_06"                "How long until detonation, then? Hmm... let's say, um... two minutes."
                "narration.countdown_07"                "Ah, now this is making things a little more fun, isn't it, Stanley?"
                "narration.countdown_08"                "It's your time to shine! You are the star! It's your story now; shape it to your heart's desires. Ooh, this is much better than what I had in mind! What a shame we have so little time left to enjoy it."
                "narration.countdown_09"                "Mere moments until the bomb goes off, but what precious moments each one of them is! More time to talk about you, about me, where we're going, what all this means... I barely know where to start!"
                "narration.countdown_10"                "What's that? You'd like to know where your co-workers are? A moment of solace before you're obliterated?"
                "narration.countdown_11"                "Alright. I'm in a good mood, and you're going to die anyway. I'll tell you exactly what happened to them: "
                "narration.countdown_12"                "I erased them. I turned off the machine; I set you free."
                "narration.countdown_13"                "Of course, that was merely in this instance of the story. Sometimes when I tell it, I simply let you sit there in your office forever, pushing buttons endlessly and then dying alone."
                "narration.countdown_14"                "Other times, I let the office sink into the ground, swallowing everyone inside; or I let it burn to a crisp."
                "narration.countdown_15"                "I have to say this, though, this version of events has been rather amusing. Watching you try to make sense of everything and take back the control wrested away from you... it's quite rich. I almost hate to see it go!"

                "narration.windowgag_3_05"        "Though if the other option is really miserable to listen to then perhaps you're not. In fact, I'm just going to say that no one who's listening to this is lucky."
                "narration.windowgag_3_06"        "Well now I've built up the other option so much that I'm going to stop talking and leave you to your decision whether to come back here, continue with the game, or just sit in this spot forever and ever. Cheers."
                "narration.ach430_1_00"                "Oh please, are you really just doing this for the achievement? Click a door 5 times, is THAT all that you think an achievement is worth? No no no, I can't just give these merits away for such little effort, a measly five clicks."
                "narration.ach430_1_01"                "Now, suppose you were to click the door TWENTY times, I would say THAT's the kind of effort that warrants recognition!"
                "narration.ach430_2_00"                "Hm. I have to say, I'm still not feeling the satisfaction of witnessing true effort for a noble cause. Perhaps fifty clicks will do it. Yes, almost certainly fifty clicks."
                "narration.ach430_3_00"                "No, no I'm still not feeling it. I want this achievement to have MEANT something, it has to be a true reward for valiant effort! I want to see some hustle Stanley, I want to see commitment, a willingness to go all the way, no matter what the cost!"
                "narration.ach430_3_01"                "Why don't you go put twenty clicks into door number 417?"
                "narration.ach430_4_00"                "Ok great, now go click a few times on door 437."
                "narration.ach430_5_00"                "Excellent, I think we're getting somewhere. Now door 415, let's give it ten clicks or so."
                "narration.ach430_6_00"                "Now back to door number 437."
                "narration.ach430_7_00"                "Let's see, how about you click on, well I don't know, the copy machine?"
                "narration.ach430_8_00"                "Alright back to room 417! I'm really feeling it now, I think we're getting somewhere!"
                "narration.ach430_9_00"                "Okay now go climb on employee 419's desk."
                "narration.ach430_10_00"        "Yes! This is great! You're putting it all on the line Stanley, I like that! Alright let's keep it up, go give me a few clicks on door 416!"
                "narration.ach430_11_00"        "We've almost got it! Now the copy machine, do that one again!"
                "narration.ach430_12_00"        "Finish it off, Stanley, 5 clicks on door 430!!"
                "narration.ach430_13_00"        "YES!! WE DID IT!! Oh wow, that felt amazing! You really earned it, Stanley, nothing could hold you back! I'm very proud of how far we've come today."
                "narration.ach430_13_01"        "Just think, only a few minutes ago you believed an achievement was worth five little clicks. Really now, what WERE you thinking."
